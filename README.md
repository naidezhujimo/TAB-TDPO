## 📢 News
- **[2025/12/12]** 🚀 **Paper Released!** We have uploaded the paper PDF directly to this repo while waiting for ArXiv endorsement.
- **[Coming Soon]** 💻 **Code Release:** The full training and evaluation scripts (including the MSC dataset processing pipeline) are being cleaned up and will be released **within this week**.

## ⚡️ Abstract

In long-context dialogue systems, models suffer from **State Inertia**, where static constraints prevent resolving conflicts between evolving user intents (e.g., "I'm now Vegan") and established historical context. Standard alignment methods like DPO incur a massive **"Alignment Tax"** (perplexity explosion >100) when trying to force these updates.

We propose **TAB-TDPO**, a non-destructive alignment framework that synergizes:
1.  **Conflict-Aware Dynamic KL Constraints (TDPO-DKL)**: Optimization level adjustment.
2.  **Learnable Temporal Attention Bias (Scalar TAB)**: Representation level filtering powered by semantic conflict detection.

**Result:** TAB-TDPO achieves **State-of-the-Art win rates (99.4% on Qwen2.5-7B)** on the Multi-Session Chat (MSC) dataset while maintaining robust zero-shot generalization and negligible perplexity overhead.

## 🌟 Key Results

### 1. SOTA Performance on Mutable State Tracking
TAB-TDPO significantly outperforms Standard DPO and SimPO on the MSC dataset, solving the "State Inertia" problem without destroying the model's general capabilities.

| Method | Win Rate (MSC) | PPL (Validation) | Alignment Tax |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Base Model (Phi-3.5)** | 20.2% | 22.1 | - |
| **Standard DPO** | 52.2% | 124.1 💥 | High |
| **SimPO** | 60.8% | 99.6 | High |
| **TAB-TDPO (Ours)** | **86.2%** | **24.8** ✅ | **Negligible** |

> **Note:** On **Qwen2.5-7B**, TAB-TDPO achieves a near-perfect **99.4% Win Rate**.

### 2. Robustness (Needle-in-a-Haystack)
Does the temporal decay make the model "forgetful"? **No.**
Our "Non-Conflicting Needle-in-a-Haystack" test confirms that TAB-TDPO retains 100% retrieval accuracy for non-conflicting facts, demonstrating precise attention regulation.

## 🛠️ Methodology

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/framework.png" width="90%">
</div>

TAB-TDPO introduces a **Conflict-Aware Adaptive Decay** mechanism.
*   **Scalar TAB:** We map dialogue turns into a latent semantic space using SBERT. A learnable scalar $\lambda$ applies a temporal bias *only* when a semantic conflict is detected between the current instruction and history.
*   **System Prompt Shielding:** We enforce a hard constraint to ensure the "System Prompt" (Safety Constitution) is never decayed, ensuring safety amidst aggressive state updates.
